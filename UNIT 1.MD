# LLM basics

## LLM Definition
A language model is a probabilistic model of text, generating a token at a time selecting from a probability distribution of possible candidates. The term *large* refeers to the number of parameters.

> *Question*: "How do we affect the probability distribution?"
> *Answer*: "We affect the probability distribution trough prompting and training."

## LLM architectures
Typically models are composed by *Encoders* and *Decoders* given the fact that they are built upon the *Transformer* architecture. Model come in different sizes (# of parameters) or for capabilities (embedding/generation).

- Encoder
- Decoder
