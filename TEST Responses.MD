1. Moving endopoint to a compartment: A notification indicates that the endpoint resource is moved to the new compartment successfully. You might notice that the endpoint status changes to Updating. After the move is successful, the endpoint status changes back to Active.
2. When is Soft prompting ideal? 
Soft prompting involves learning a small set of continuous embeddings that guide the model's behavior without modifying its original parameters. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, soft prompts require no task-specific training of the full model and are efficient in adapting LLMs to different tasks with minimal computational overhead. This makes it ideal for scenarios where full fine-tuning is impractical but some level of customization is needed.
3. Semantic relationships are the focus of Vector search
4. LCEL are the declarative solution for connetcting LLM apps with tools
5. OCI generative AI does not preserve queries and retrieved context after session, and is not used for training.
6. Oracle DB uses ports 1521-1522 range
7. cohere-r-08-2024 uses 8 units per cluster
8. ranker chooses and prioritize retrieved content for RAG
9. fine tuning reduces the number of tokens needed
10. Knowledge base data types supported are: OCI search with Open Search, OCI Object storage with text/pdfs 23ai vector search not custom built file systems
11. The column for the embedding is VECTOR type
